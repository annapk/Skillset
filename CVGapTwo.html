        <p>And this little CV gap is around 32 kilograms, also almost invisible if you just squint a bit. A half of him might even fit in a purse if you like IKEA bag sized purses. <br>Or alright, probably he is indeed not really a handbag dog, but we could call him a trolley case dog? Maybe?<br><br>He misses me when I am gone too long though. Dog-friendly offices or work-life-balance-enabling schedules are things we both deeply care about.</p>
