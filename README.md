there are description metatags on some pages, so see there. even two description metatags on some (hope two descriptions work with google but if not SOOOO SOOOORRY :) - and overall more comments on this entire page than content probably but that's exactly why it's so fun :D (or in other words: "careful, student online. footnotes dude. FOOTNOTES!") - page is in progress. bu that is no reason why that progress should be so private, so it goes public right from the start.
