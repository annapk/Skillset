I care for 1. the product as such, whether making sense or not, 2. whether the company pays taxes, 3. work ethics and ethics with workers, including minimum wages, vacation times, and also if you have too many people on management and on top you give them "boni", YOU'RE OUT just like the dude who pays no taxes but thinks he can pose as a "president" after losing the popular vote on top of losing everything else (a couple times over). 4. payment reliability (if you are just another joke like Trump who hires people and then plays tricks to not pay them, YOU'RE OUT). if you back that shit behaviour up by "helping" an asshole to steal on and an after countless tax evasions, nonpayments to workers and countless bancruptcies like the deutsche bank helped trump, YOU'RE OUT. 5. if you voted for him past elections GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE, I DON'T SPEAK WITH YOU.</b>
