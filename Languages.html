<!-- languages: 

several years of work experience as freelance translator (as opposed to interpreter) for the language pairs EN to DE and PL to DE

spoken languages: in spite of concentrating on translation not interpreting, mastering of all three languages can be described as either native level or as close to native as possible when living in a multinational cultural surrounding and regularly using all three in spoken communication, too (though in a cascading order of frequency: polish being topped by english which again is being topped by german 'amount of words per day' in terms of training spoken language proficiency and keeping it up-to-date) <the recruiter who gave up on this paragraph does not know shit about the relevance of keeping your language stuff trained, especially if you got grey hair on your head to distract from!! >

"Computerlinguistik": well... not yet a deeper insight yet, but I am getting there. That department was not (yet?) part of the philology studies curriculum when I studied at the FU, but I am trying to catch up on that (see web development / languages being trained) < well I need to make SOME kind of connection between the languages part of my ... life -and- educational -and- professional background on the one hand and 'computer language as a language' as opposed to being another way of writing a math-like form (which is more like it but I don't need to tell that on this exact subpage which is trying to draw a line that needs to be drawn to avoid my CV looking too confusing. there is a lot of jumping around in my CV and I need to make all those jumps to somehow look like carefully planned and professionally executed acrobatics, preferably on an almost-olympic level. Almost!) >
